    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>In 2.3, we defined a CSS selector as the portion of the CSS rule that tells the brower 
on which HTML element to apply hte defined style.

    <ul>
        <li>When your HTML is simple, the selectors can be simple as well</li>
        <li>he most basic selectors simple mirror the HTML tag</li>
        <li>For example "p" attaches to all tags, "img" will attach to all tags and so on</li>
        <li>As you can imagine, there will often be times</li>
        <li>when you don't want every single HTML element of a particular type to have identical
style</ul>
    </u1>
    <p>
In Module 3, we'll discuss a variety of ways to use selectors to attach to specific HTML elements.
in unit 2.2, we briefly mentioned the fact that properties apply to the entire hierachy of HTML
elements to which they are attachted.  This means that you will have to be very careful which selectors
you choose to use in combination with your chosen style.

        <li>This would affect the style of all link tags on the page</li>
        <li>This would affect the style of all paragraph tags on the page</li>
        <li>and the style of elements contained within the paragraph tag</li>
        <li>This would apply style to the body tag</li>
        <li>as well as allow the elements inside the body tag to inherit certain styles applied
here</li>
